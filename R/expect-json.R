#' Test that objects would generate equivalent JSON
#'
#' Named lists in R are ordered, but they translate to unordered objects in
#' JSON. This test expectation loosens the equality check of two objects to
#' ignore the order of elements in a named list.
#' @param object object to test
#' @param expected expected value
#' @param info extra information to be included in the message
#' @param label character name by which to refer to `object` in the test
#' result. Because the tools for deparsing object names that 'testthat' uses
#' aren't exported from that package, the default here is just "object".
#' @param expected.label character same as `label` but for `expected`
#' @return Invisibly, returns `object` for optionally passing to other
#' expectations.

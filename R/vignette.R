#' Set mocking/capturing state for a vignette
#'
#' Use `start_vignette()` to either use previously recorded responses, if they
#' exist, or capture real responses for future use.
#'
#' In a vignette or other R Markdown or Sweave document, place
#' `start_vignette()` in an R code block at the beginning,
#' before the first API request is made, and put
#' `end_vignette()` in a R code chunk at the end. You may
#' want to make those R code chunks have `echo=FALSE` in order to hide the fact
#' that you're calling them.
#'
#' The behavior changes based on the existence of the `path` directory. The
#' first time you build the vignette, the directory won't exist yet, so it will
#' make real requests and record them inside of `path`. On subsequent runs, the
#' mocks will be used. To record fresh responses from the server, delete the
#' `path` directory, and the responses will be recorded again the next time the
#' vignette runs.
#'
#' If you have additional setup code that you'd like available across all of
#' your package's vignettes, put it in `inst/httptest/start-vignette.R` in your
#' package, and it will be called in `start_vignette()` before the mock/record
#' context is set. Similarly, teardown code can go in
#' `inst/httptest/end-vignette.R`, evaluated in `end_vignette()` after mocking
#' is stopped.
#'
#' @param path Root file path for the mocks for this vignette. A good idea is
#' to use the file name of the vignette itself.
#' @param ... Optional arguments passed to `start_capturing()`
#' @return Nothing; called for its side effect of starting/ending
#' response recording or mocking.
#' @export
#' @seealso [start_capturing()] for how requests are recorded; [use_mock_api()]
#' for how previously recorded requests are loaded; [change_state()] for how to
#' handle recorded requests when the server state is changing;
#' `vignette("vignettes", package="httptest")` for an overview of all

#' Handle a change of server state
#'
#' In a vignette, put a call to `change_state()` before any code block that
#' makes a change on
#' the server, or rather, before any code block that might repeat the same
#' request previously done and expect a different result.
#'
#' `change_state()` works by layering a new directory on top of the existing
#' [.mockPaths()], so fixtures are recorded/loaded there, masking rather than
#' overwriting previously recorded responses for the same request. In
#' vignettes, these mock layers are subdirectories with integer names.
#'
#' @return Invisibly, the return of `.mockPaths()` with the new path added.
#' @export

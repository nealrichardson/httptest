#' Use or create mock files depending on their existence
#'
#' This context will switch the [.mockPaths()] to `tests/testthat/dir`
#' (and then resets it to what it was before).
#' If the `tests/testthat/dir` folder doesn't exist, [capture_requests()] will
#' be run to create mocks.
#' If it exists, [with_mock_api()] will be run.
#' To re-record mock files, simply delete `tests/testthat/dir` and run the test.
#'
#' @param dir character string, unique folder name that will be used or created
#' under `tests/testthat/`
#' @inheritParams with_mock_api
#' @inheritParams start_capturing
#' @param replace Logical: should the mock directory replace current mock
#' directories? Default is `TRUE`.
#'

#' Serve a mock API from files
#'
#' In this context, HTTP requests attempt to load API response fixtures from
#' files. This allows test code to proceed evaluating code that expects
#' HTTP requests to return meaningful responses. Requests that do not have a
#' corresponding fixture file raise errors, like how [without_internet()]
#' does.
#'
#' Requests are translated to mock file paths according to several rules that
#' incorporate the request method, URL, query parameters, and body. See
#' [build_mock_url()] for details.
#'
#' File paths for API fixture files may be relative to the 'tests/testthat'
#' directory, i.e. relative to the .R test files themselves. This is the default
#' location for storing and retrieving mocks, but you can put them anywhere you
#' want as long as you set the appropriate location with [.mockPaths()].
#'
#' In the interest of standardizing naming conventions, `with_mock_api()` is the
#' preferred name for this context; `with_mock_API()` is being deprecated.
#'
#' @param expr Code to run inside the fake context
#' @return The result of `expr`
#' @seealso [use_mock_api()] to enable mocking on its own (not in a context); [build_mock_url()]; [.mockPaths()]
#' @export
with_mock_api <- function(expr) {
  use_mock_api()
  on.exit(stop_mocking())

#' Turn on API mocking
#'
#' This function intercepts HTTP requests made through `httr` and serves mock
#' file responses instead. It is what [with_mock_api()] does, minus the
#' automatic disabling of mocking when the context finishes.
#'
#' Note that you in order to resume normal request behavior, you will need to
#' call [stop_mocking()] yourself---this function does not clean up after itself
#' as 'with_mock_api` does.
#' @return Nothing; called for its side effects.

mock_request <- function(req, handle, refresh) {
  # If there's a query, then req$url has been through build_url(parse_url())

#' Convert a request to a mock file path
#'
#' Requests are translated to mock file paths according to several rules that
#' incorporate the request method, URL, query parameters, and body.
#'
#' First, the request protocol, such as "https://", is removed from the URL.
#' Second, if the request URL contains a query string, it will be popped off,
#' hashed by [digest::digest()], and the first six characters appended to the
#' file being read. Third, request bodies are similarly hashed and
#' appended. Finally, if a request method other than GET is used it will be
#' appended to the end of the end of the file name.
#'
#' Mock file paths also have a file extension appended, based on the
#' `Content-Type` of the response, though this function, which is only concerned
#' with the request, does not add the extension. In an
#' HTTP API, a "directory" itself is a resource,
#' so the extension allows distinguishing directories and files in the file
#' system. That is, a mocked `GET("http://example.com/api/")` may read a
#' "example.com/api.json" file, while
#' `GET("http://example.com/api/object1/")` reads "example.com/api/object1.json".
#'
#' Other examples:
#' * `GET("http://example.com/api/object1/?a=1")` may read
#' "example.com/api/object1-b64371.xml".
#' * `POST("http://example.com/api/object1/?a=1")` may read
#' "example.com/api/object1-b64371-POST.json".
#'
#' This function is exported so that other packages can construct similar mock
#' behaviors or override specific requests at a higher level than
#' `with_mock_api` mocks.
#'
#' In the interest of standardizing naming conventions, `build_mock_url()` is
#' the preferred name for this function; `buildMockURL()` is deprecated.
#'
#' Note that if you are trying to guess the mock file paths corresponding to a
#' test for which you intend to create a mock file manually,
#' instead of trying to build the URL, you should run the test
#' with `with_mock_api` as the error message will contain the mock file path.
#'
#' @param req A `request` object, or a character "URL" to convert
#' @param method character HTTP method. If `req` is a 'request' object,
#' its request method will override this argument
#' @return A file path and name, without an extension. The file, or a file with
#' some extension appended, may or may not
#' exist: existence is not a concern of this function.

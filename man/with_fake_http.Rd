\title{Make all HTTP requests return a fake response}
\usage{
with_fake_http(expr)

with_fake_HTTP(expr)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{Code to run inside the fake context}
}
\value{
The result of \code{expr}
}
\description{
In this context, HTTP verb functions raise a 'message' so that test code can
assert that the requests are made. As in \code{\link[=without_internet]{without_internet()}}, the message
raised has a well-defined shape, made of three
elements, separated by space: (1) the request
method (e.g. "GET" or "POST"); (2) the request URL; and
(3) the request body, if present. The verb-expectation functions,
such as \code{expect_GET} and \code{expect_POST}, look for this shape.
}
\details{
Unlike \code{without_internet},
the HTTP functions do not error and halt execution, instead returning a
\code{response}-class object so that code calling the HTTP functions can
proceed with its response handling logic and itself be tested. The response
it returns echoes back most of the request itself, similar to how some
endpoints on \url{http://httpbin.org} do.

In the interest of standardizing naming conventions, \code{with_fake_http()} is
the preferred name for this context; \code{with_fake_HTTP()} is deprecated.

Title: A Test Environment for HTTP Requests
Description: Testing code and packages that communicate with remote servers can
    be painful. Dealing with authentication, bootstrapping server state,
    cleaning up objects that may get created during the test run, network
    flakiness, and other complications can make testing seem too costly to
    bother with. But it doesn't need to be that hard. This package enables one
    to test all of the logic on the R sides of the API in your package without
    requiring access to the remote service. Importantly, it provides three test
    contexts that mock the network connection in different ways, and it offers
    additional expectations to assert that HTTP requests were--or were
    not--made. Using these tools, one can test that code is making the intended
    requests and that it handles the expected responses correctly, all without
    depending on a connection to a remote API.
